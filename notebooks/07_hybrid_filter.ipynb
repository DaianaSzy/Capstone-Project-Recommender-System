       "      <td>I love Leap bar soaps (LOVE!), and was curious about their liquid hand soap. It is a 12 ounce pump style bottle with visually pleasing label. The soap comes out thick and rich. It is super luxurious feeling- it lathers significantly all the while feeling like hand cream. It rinses well and leaves skin feeling soft. Probably the most soft. Perhaps a little coating of glycerin and aloe are left behind? Yet not a gross coating.  I am trying to figure out the magic of my soft, smooth, clean feeling hands on a super cold (18*F), dry day. Super moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly, I find it has barely any scent. I am used to their super scented bar soaps, and I was expecting a stronger scent to come through. I am not usually keen on perfume (causes headaches, nausea), but when a product uses essential oils for scenting (especially hand soap and house cleaners), I find it delightfully uplifting. This is labeled as lemongrass, but that isn't the only essential oil used. The profile is more complex with the addition of lemon oil, orange oil, and rosemary. I was really excited for this to have a robust citrus smell. I really couldn't tell you just by sniffing. It smells fresh and clean, but it isn't strong (and I was hoping/expecting strong). I see other reviewers mentioning a strong smell. I figured I got a weird bottle or I have covid. I actually went and grabbed my Leap bar soap to make sure I could still smell that. I can. Phew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm still going 5 stars because it does have a mild fresh scent, and the soap itself is glorious. Very rich, super moisturizing lather. And it rinses away perfectly. I dont feel like I am working to get the soap off. If it did, I wouldn't like that. So there is some sorcery involved here, lol. I kinda want it as a body wash. My hands feel SO GOOD after using this. I just keep touching my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One does not need a lot of soap, so feel free to just add a little to the hand. I would even go so far as to add a little water as it goes down. Or if you like this soap and have a foamer, then just a wee bit of this with a lot of water will do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love their designs on the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Olive Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Guar Gum, Lemongrass Oil, Orange Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Lemon Oil, Rosemary Extract, Organic Aloe Vera (Potassium Hydroxide is used to saponify the organic oils into soap, but none remains in the final product)</td>\n",

       "781   I love Leap bar soaps (LOVE!), and was curious about their liquid hand soap. It is a 12 ounce pump style bottle with visually pleasing label. The soap comes out thick and rich. It is super luxurious feeling- it lathers significantly all the while feeling like hand cream. It rinses well and leaves skin feeling soft. Probably the most soft. Perhaps a little coating of glycerin and aloe are left behind? Yet not a gross coating.  I am trying to figure out the magic of my soft, smooth, clean feeling hands on a super cold (18*F), dry day. Super moisturizing.<br /><br />Oddly, I find it has barely any scent. I am used to their super scented bar soaps, and I was expecting a stronger scent to come through. I am not usually keen on perfume (causes headaches, nausea), but when a product uses essential oils for scenting (especially hand soap and house cleaners), I find it delightfully uplifting.

It comes in a little dropper bottle that is common for this kind of product. The serum is a prickly pear oil that is supposed to be very good for your face.<br /><br />When you use it you will first notice the fragrance of the oil. I am not sure if maybe my bottle went bad, but mine just smelled very bad, almost like oil that went rancid. I really didnâ€™t like it at all and it makes it difficult using this product especially since that smell lingered for some time on top of it.<br /><br />The oil is on the lighter side, and even so it took a while to absorb and my skin felt greasy for some time. I would not recommend using this during the day. Especially when wearing a mask, using a facial oil that leaves an oily residue makes my face very hot and sweaty, just awful and this one would do exactly that. Sadly this one is just average at best and I will not be re-purchasing when I run out.   \n",

The product is unscented but the natural scent of the oil kind of smells like old olive oil. But that smell goes away too.   \n",

You should see my bathroom cabinets. Trying to consolidate, but I get different rashes in different places, and no one thing works for everything.<br /><br />This is very gentle and did not make my skin or face or scalp break out or rash up at all. It's not super moisturizing, but it wasn't drying, either. The scent is very light, and the cleanser has a little minty/tingly kick. This would have worked for me in my teens or 20s when I couldn't wait to get out of the shower and on with my life.   \n",

This sinks in and goes to work keeping your face hydrated and not tight. There is sort of an odd scent to it, but it isn't overpowering. I have heard great things about prickly pear oils and this definitely lived up to my expectations.   \n",

       "781   i love leap bar soaps love!, and was curious about their liquid hand soap. it is a 12 ounce pump style bottle with visually pleasing label. the soap comes out thick and rich. it is super luxurious feeling it lathers significantly all the while feeling like hand cream. it rinses well and leaves skin feeling soft. probably the most soft. perhaps a little coating of glycerin and aloe are left behind? yet not a gross coating. i am trying to figure out the magic of my soft, smooth, clean feeling hands on a super cold 18f, dry day. super moisturizing.oddly, i find it has barely any scent. i am used to their super scented bar soaps, and i was expecting a stronger scent to come through. i am not usually keen on perfume causes headaches, nausea, but when a product uses essential oils for scenting especially hand soap and house cleaners, i find it delightfully uplifting. this is labeled as lemongrass, but that isnt the only essential oil used. the profile is more complex with the addition of lemon oil, orange oil, and rosemary. i was really excited for this to have a robust citrus smell. i really couldnt tell you just by sniffing. it smells fresh and clean, but it isnt strong and i was hopingexpecting strong. i see other reviewers mentioning a strong smell. i figured i got a weird bottle or i have covid. i actually went and grabbed my leap bar soap to make sure i could still smell that. i can. phew.im still going 5 stars because it does have a mild fresh scent, and the soap itself is glorious. very rich, super moisturizing lather. and it rinses away perfectly. i dont feel like i am working to get the soap off. if it did, i wouldnt like that. so there is some sorcery involved here, lol. i kinda want it as a body wash. my hands feel so good after using this. i just keep touching my hands.one does not need a lot of soap, so feel free to just add a little to the hand. i would even go so far as to add a little water as it goes down. or if you like this soap and have a foamer, then just a wee bit of this with a lot of water will do it.love their designs on the bottles.water, organic coconut oil, organic olive oil, vegetable glycerin, organic guar gum, lemongrass oil, orange oil, organic jojoba oil, lemon oil, rosemary extract, organic aloe vera potassium hydroxide is used to saponify the organic oils into soap, but none remains in the final product  \\\n",

       "781       i love leap bar soaps love!, and was curious about their liquid hand soap. it is a 12 ounce pump style bottle with visually pleasing label. the soap comes out thick and rich. it is super luxurious feeling it lathers significantly all the while feeling like hand cream. it rinses well and leaves skin feeling soft. probably the most soft. perhaps a little coating of glycerin and aloe are left behind? yet not a gross coating. i am trying to figure out the magic of my soft, smooth, clean feeling hands on a super cold 18f, dry day. super moisturizing.oddly, i find it has barely any scent. i am used to their super scented bar soaps, and i was expecting a stronger scent to come through. i am not usually keen on perfume causes headaches, nausea, but when a product uses essential oils for scenting especially hand soap and house cleaners, i find it delightfully uplifting. this is labeled as lemongrass, but that isnt the only essential oil used. the profile is more complex with the addition of lemon oil, orange oil, and rosemary. i was really excited for this to have a robust citrus smell. i really couldnt tell you just by sniffing. it smells fresh and clean, but it isnt strong and i was hopingexpecting strong. i see other reviewers mentioning a strong smell. i figured i got a weird bottle or i have covid. i actually went and grabbed my leap bar soap to make sure i could still smell that. i can. phew.im still going 5 stars because it does have a mild fresh scent, and the soap itself is glorious. very rich, super moisturizing lather. and it rinses away perfectly. i dont feel like i am working to get the soap off. if it did, i wouldnt like that. so there is some sorcery involved here, lol. i kinda want it as a body wash. my hands feel so good after using this. i just keep touching my hands.one does not need a lot of soap, so feel free to just add a little to the hand. i would even go so far as to add a little water as it goes down. or if you like this soap and have a foamer, then just a wee bit of this with a lot of water will do it.love their designs on the bottles.water, organic coconut oil, organic olive oil, vegetable glycerin, organic guar gum, lemongrass oil, orange oil, organic jojoba oil, lemon oil, rosemary extract, organic aloe vera potassium hydroxide is used to saponify the organic oils into soap, but none remains in the final product\n",
