       "2398  My skin is really sensitive.<br /><br />I also don't generally like all-in-one products. You should see my bathroom cabinets. Trying to consolidate, but I get different rashes in different places, and no one thing works for everything.<br /><br />This is very gentle and did not make my skin or face or scalp break out or rash up at all. It's not super moisturizing, but it wasn't drying, either. The scent is very light, and the cleanser has a little minty/tingly kick. This would have worked for me in my teens or 20s when I couldn't wait to get out of the shower and on with my life.  \\\n",

I did not expect it to work well but am very thankful to be wrong. It thickens to the normal consistency of conditioners after it cools. It’s very moisturizing for my thick curly hair. My only issue was the scent. Very strong herbal scent. It was not really my thing but a little added essential oil was all it needed. However, in the future I’ll just order the unscented and add my own scent   \n",

It reminds me of scented talcum powders my Grandma used to use, kind of a spicy floral smell.  I personally think it is too strong and would not want to go around smelling that way if I can help it. That said, it works well to decrease the appearance of oily roots and can extend your hair wash by a day for sure, if you can stand the smell.  I will keep it as a backup for when I run out of  the other lighter scented dry shampoos.   \n",

I will order again because it works.  My hair--blonde by Aveda--looks great and does have more volume between complete washings.  I am planning several trips this year and this Captain Blankenship product will be traveling with me for the quick lifts and for in-depth pick-me-ups between shampoo/conditionings.  The rose geranium scent is subtle and refreshing.  A real 5 star product.   \n",

       "671603    spent a while looking for an allnatural dry shampoo, as i wasnt comfortable spraying chemicals in my hair. this product is it!the powder has a light rosy scentnothing overpowering. as a woman in my early twenties, i was concerned itd smell like something our grandparents would wear, but thats not the case. even if you think differently, the scent dissipates rather quickly.i suggest using this before bed, or before your hair gets really oily, as it does a better job of preventing oiliness. definitely a great buy if youre looking for a natural dry shampoo!\n",
       "671604             i have spent some time trying out dry shampoos since the powder i swore by was discontinued naturelle biotera only makes a spray dry shampoo now and it doesnt make my hair feel clean. i am so happy with the mermaid powder and in love with the sweet rose scent bonus. i can get away with washing my hair once a week again! the most important part about this dry shampoo is that it makes my hair feel clean after application! i have been searching far and wide and other products just let me down. i love this and have already recommended it to friends.\n",
