Not at all subtle.  It reminds me of scented talcum powders my Grandma used to use, kind of a spicy floral smell.  I personally think it is too strong and would not want to go around smelling that way if I can help it. That said, it works well to decrease the appearance of oily roots and can extend your hair wash by a day for sure, if you can stand the smell.  I will keep it as a backup for when I run out of  the other lighter scented dry shampoos.

I admit I ordered this product because I loved the &#34;mermaid&#34; part of the name and because the ingredients were ones I could recognize.  I will order again because it works.  My hair--blonde by Aveda--looks great and does have more volume between complete washings.  I am planning several trips this year and this Captain Blankenship product will be traveling with me for the quick lifts and for in-depth pick-me-ups between shampoo/conditionings.

       "110606    im revising my review and deducting a star. id already mentioned how crazy bad this burns if it gets in your eyes, but it bears repeating. the new info here is that 2 of my household users get an itchy scalp after use. maybe diamond powder as its 9th active ingredient isnt such a fabulous idea?? ingredients: aqua watereau, sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate, cocamidopropyl betaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, cocamide mipa, peg120 methyl glucose dioleate, glycol distearate, diamond powder, emblica officinalis fruit extract, salvia officinalis sage leaf extract, helianthus annuus sunflower seed extract, hydrolyzed quinoa, brassica campestris rapeseed seed oil, sesamum indicum sesame seed oil, silicone quaternium16, polyquaternium7, undeceth11, butyloctanol, polyquaternium10, undeceth5, cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride, phenoxyethanol, acrylates copolymer, disodium edta, glycerin, citric acid, sodium hydroxide, methylchloroisothiazolinone, methylisothiazolinone.i ended up liking this shampoo more than i thought i would. i took a spin around aiirs website, a brand i was previously unfamiliar with. their lane is definitely upmarket holisticnew agey. and those two words shouldnt be mutually exclusive imo. im personally not a big fan of hawking diamonds and crystals and other marketing hooks that arent scientifically proven to actually benefit hair. it jacks up the price point and borders upon gimmicky. however, finding truly fragrancefree shampoo is not an easy task... and this indeed is. and they are also leaping bunny certified, which i verified because im persnickety like that. some small crueltyfree labels are still owned by a large parent company that isnt leaping bunny certified, but aiir is fully good to go. so high marks there.the formula lathers a lot more than i expected. here the sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate replaces the heavier sulfate thats usually found in the first couple of ingredients; its a very mild surfactant, yet lathers quite well and rinses out easily. as a lot of newer generation brands are replacing nowvilified ingredients, i should note that the way we get sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate technically involves ethylene oxide which is not without controversy. in 20 years itll also be replaced by something even bettersafer. but for now, this is a very friendly cleanser option and my colortreated hair appreciates it.my mom and have radically different hair types; shes got thin, baby fine hair that needs body and i have thick, coarse, curls that i try hard to tame and devolumize. both of us didnt have remarkable results after using this, but we did note our hair felt pretty soft. while i dont know if i believe all of aiirs claims here about hair growth, i am impressed that the two of us could share a shampoo... as thats something we can usually never do. this also preforms well in hard water.im leaving it 4 stars because of how much it stung my eyes when some suds fell into them during my shower. and because of the diamond nonsense. you also dont get a lot vs price point. but for gentle yet effective cleansing in a truly fragrancefree formula, yeah, not bad! nice choice for a guest bathroom as this shouldnt trigger many allergies, is gender neutral, and can work on all hair types.this was a vine item for me but unless i see some wow factor pretty soon, once this is gone i dont plan to buy any outright.\n",
